- Developed an intuition of back-propagation and saw it work on data.

- Recognized that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.

- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

-Implemented a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer

-Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh

-Computed the cross entropy loss

-Implement forward and backward propagation
